Point Source Demo

## Overview 
These examples are designed to help you learn about how to conduct a point source search using IceCube Software. 

## Using GitHub
GitHub is a way to track changes and edits to code, as well as to collaborate on a code. 

To use this repository, you can `clone` it into a folder on your `scratch` directory:

```console
mkdir bootcamp-ps-demo
git clone https://github.com/jessiethw/Bootcamp-PS-demo.git bootcamp-ps-demo
```

You will then have your own copy of the code in a folder called `bootcamp-ps-demo`. We will go through this example and answers in the Point Source Activity during Bootcamp. Try to complete the exercises without looking at the answers, until we go through the answers together.
