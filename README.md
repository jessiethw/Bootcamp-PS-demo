## Overview 
These examples are designed to help you learn about how to conduct a point source search using IceCube Software. 

## Using GitHub
GitHub is a way to track changes and edits to code, as well as to collaborate on a code. 

To use this repository, you can `clone` it into a folder:

```console
mkdir bootcamp-ps-demo
git clone https://github.com/jessiethw/Bootcamp-PS-demo.git bootcamp-ps-demo
```

You will then have your own copy of the code in a folder called `bootcamp-ps-demo`
